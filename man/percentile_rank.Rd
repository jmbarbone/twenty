\usage{
percentile_rank(x, ...)

\method{percentile_rank}{default}(x, weights = NULL, ...)

\method{percentile_rank}{table}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of values to rank}

\item{...}{Additional parameters sent to methods}

\item{weights}{A vector of the number of times to repeat \code{x}}
}
\value{
The percentile rank of \code{x} between 0 and 1 (see Boundaries)
}
\description{
The bounds of the percentile rank are > 0 and < 1 (see Boundaries)

A percentile rank here is the proportion of scores that are less than the
current score.

\deqn{PR = (c_L + 0.5 f_i) / N}

Where

\eqn{c_L} is the frequency of scores less than the score of interest

\eqn{f_i} is the frequency of the score of interest
}
\details{
Computes a percentile rank for each score in a set.
}
\section{Boundaries}{


While the percentile rank of a score in a set must be exclusively within the
boundaries of \code{0} and \code{1}, this function may produce a percentile rank that
is exactly \code{0} or \code{1}.  This may occur when the number of values are so large
that the value within the boundaries is too small to be differentiated.

Additionally, when using the \code{weights} parameter, if the lowest or highest
number has a value of \code{0}, the number will then have a theoretical \code{0} or
\code{1}, as these values are not actually within the set.

\examples{
percentile_rank(0:9)
x <- c(1, 2, 1, 7, 5, NA_integer_, 7, 10)
percentile_rank(x)

# with weights
percentile_rank(7:1, c(1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1))
}
